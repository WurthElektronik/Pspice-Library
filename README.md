## Introduction
PSpice is a SPICE circuit simulator application for the simulation and verification of analog and mixed-signal circuits. It integrates easily with Cadence PCB schematic entry solutions like OrCAD Capture and comes with an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

For how to use models in GitHub repository, you can refer to the help document in this folder.
